## CONFLICTS

I encountered multiple errors while trying to deploy to Heroku. One of which was missing the root (route) in my html routes file.

```
router.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../public/index.html'))
});
```
I was also missing the node_module in my gitignore file. (See below image for example)
